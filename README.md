# CraftOS-PC 2 Turtle Plugin
This repository contains the turtle plugin for CraftOS-PC. This plugin adds rudimentary support for emulating turtles in CraftOS-PC.

## Usage
Just drop the plugin file for your platform into the plugins folder in CraftOS-PC. See [the CraftOS-PC documentation](https://www.craftos-pc.cc/docs/plugins) for where to find this.

Once installed, you can attach a turtle peripheral in the same way you would attach a normal computer. Turtles are basically a specialization of a computer that adds the `turtle` API as well as an API to manage the turtle's inventory, blocks, etc.
